The Fair Squares (FS) platform enables fractional ownership of real estate and rentals. With FS, the housing market becomes more transparent, fair and accessible to tenants, co-owners and investors. 

At its core, FS is a community-agreed protocol, which establishes and executes rental agreements and associated social co-investment returns. It enables the combination of availability of affordable housing with return on social investment.

FS allows individuals in communities to own, manage homes and newcomers to easily enter the rental market. Compared to current mainstream mortgage financing, the Fair Squares social crowd financing model achieves 30% lower rental prices thanks to new distributed governance and organizational technologies.
